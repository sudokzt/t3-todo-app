# Disclaimer

1. Use SQLite for permanence.
2. There is a part of the props bucket relay. For the actual product, I believe global state should be used.
3. If you want to see how it behaves, please verify on localhost (maybe need google authentication setting)

# Impressions

This is the first time I have used following.

- Vitest as test tool
- tRPC
- Prisma

I found it easy to develop and would like to use it in the future.
